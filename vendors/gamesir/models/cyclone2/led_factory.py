GameSir Cyclone 2 - captured lighting baseline (bank 0x20, records 0-3)
======================================================================
Snapshot of the four lighting preset records as read from THIS unit before any
of the Linux-side experiments modified them (the first gamesir_regdump run).
Used by the GUI's "Restore presets" button to undo edits.

Layout: selector at 0x0000; record M at 0x0001 + M*0x7c (124 bytes each). This
covers records 0..3 = addresses 0x0001..0x01f0.

To regenerate on another unit: run `sudo python3 research/gamesir_regdump.py 32 0x0000
0x0200` and paste the rows below.

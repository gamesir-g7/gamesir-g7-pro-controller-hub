GameSir Cyclone 2 - command / write layer
=========================================
Everything the host SENDS to the controller over the vendor command channel
(report 0x0F): the shared device handle, the thread-safe writer, and the
high-level commands (profile, rumble, register write).

Commands and the read loop share ONE hid handle across threads, so every write
goes through a single lock. The handle is REBOUND on each reconnect, so callers
must never cache it: `send_cmd` reads the current handle live, and the reader
publishes the handle via `set_device` / `clear_device`.

    `0f 03 …` register write; the G7 wraps the SAME inner command in its
    sequenced envelope `0f 00 <seq> 3c | 03 …` (write_style on the profile).

    A multi-register operation (config Apply / backup restore) captures the
    profile's `write_style` ONCE and passes it here, so a controller switch

    newly-bound unit. Returns False on the first refused/failed chunk.

    The WHOLE chunk sequence runs under _wseq_lock: send_cmd's lock only makes
    individual commands atomic, so two concurrent write_reg calls (every bridge
    write spawns its own thread — e.g. editing L4's and R4's macros in quick
    succession) interleaved their chunks with no spacing, and the controller
    SILENTLY DROPS commands that arrive back-to-back. Measured on-device
